          <strong>27 Jan 2022 - </strong>To support the national efforts in combating the pandemic and to increase 
          awareness towards the importance of routine testing, <strong>TheTestingPro</strong> is proud 
          to announce the launch of the "<strong>I DO ROUTINE TESTING</strong>"
          Challenge (IDRTC).
        </p>
        <p class="">
          <strong>
            Routine testing is a key component in safeguarding our community and workplaces. It enables early 
            detection and prevents widespread transmission. It can help reduce the occurrence of Covid-19 
            infection and protect those in our population who are the most vulnerable to complications.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the “I DO ROUTINE TESTING” campaign, we wish to encourage compliance towards routine 
          testing as well as promote voluntary routine testing. We hope that more people will know the 
          importance of and how routine testing helps in early detection, the critical role it plays in 
          ringfencing and isolating infections, which all contributes to blocking (or at least minimizing) 
          widespread transmission. 
        </p>
        <p>
          With the number of asymptomatic Covid-19 cases that are reported being on the rise, and along 
          with the festive season just around the corner, where there are bound to be visitations and mini 
          gatherings, albeit with Safe Management Measures in place that are to be strictly adhered to, 
          routine testing plays an even bigger role in making our community safe, as well as protecting 
          the well-being of our families, loved ones and friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Together, we can all make a difference. We will overcome this pandemic and seamlessly 
            transit towards endemicity, sooner than later!
          </strong>
