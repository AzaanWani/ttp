            Routine testing is key to safeguarding our community and workplace. It enables early detection

          To support the national efforts in combating the pandemic, and to increase awareness towards the 
          importance of routine testing, <strong>TheTestingPro</strong> is proud to launch the "<strong>I DO ROUTINE TESTING</strong>"
          Challenge campaign.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this campaign, we wish to encourage compliance to routine testing as well as promote 
          voluntary testing. We want more people to know about the importance of routine testing, and how 
          it helps to ringfence and isolate infected cases, which can block widespread transmission. And 
          with the growing number of asymptomatic Covid-19 cases being reported, routine testing plays a 
          very big part in making our community and workplace safer.
