            <p>
              Testing continues to be an important part of the Nationâ€™s strategy to detect and ringfence 
              infections in the community early. Mandatory <b>Fast and Easy Test (FET) Rostered Routine Testing 
              (RRT)</b> is in place for higher-risk settings such as F&B, personal care services, and gym and 
              fitness studios, has been extended to more settings with frequent community interactions such as 
              retail mall workers, supermarket staff, last-mile delivery personnel (including parcel and food 
              delivery personnel), and public and private transport workers (taxi drivers, private hire car 
              drivers and all public transport frontline staff). All workers working in such settings must also 
              undergo a seven-day FET RRT regime now.

            <p>
                To comply to the mandatory <b>FET RRT</b> regime, Employers now have the choice of either: 
                <ul style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                  <li>Book appointments at the Quick Test Centres (QTC) for their employees to do the ART tests; or </li>
                  <li>Adopt the <b>Employer-led Supervised Self-Swab(ESSS)</b> model and conduct inhouse.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>  
              <p>
                While Companies are strongly encouraged to adopt the ESSS due to its supposed ease of 
                implementation and flexibility, this model does come with its own set of challenges for 
                Companies and Businesses, both operationally and administratively. 
              </p>           
              <p>
                For a start, Companies will be required to have adequate number of HMI-trained "supervisors" to 
                supervise such tests, either physically or remotely via video calling. If the ART tests are to be 
                done physically onsite, there must be a suitable site for employees to administer the self-swabs, 
                and the need to ensure proper Infection protection control (IPC) is strictly adhered to. Employees
                may have trouble performing the correct swabbing techniques that may likely lead to unnecessary 
                time wastage or inconclusive results. The tracking of attendance and updating of results can be 
                very tedious and time consuming.
