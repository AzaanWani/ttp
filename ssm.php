        	<h4>About Self Swab Model</h4>         
            <p>
              The Self-Swab Model (SSM) is a swab test operating model that allows swab testing to be conducted at the premises of 
              the company. The swab test will be carried out by an appointed Healthcare Provider together with a partnering laboratory.

            </p>    
            <p>
              Companies that adopt the SSM can apply for the Self-Swab Grant, which is an initiative by HPB to promote greater 
              flexibility, sustainability, and ownership of swab testing in the companies whose workers need to undergo Rostered 
              Routine Testing (RRT).
            </p>
            <p>
              The Self-Swab Grant provides support to companies in partnering with approved private healthcare providers (HCPs) in 
              the administration and conduct of Rostered Routine Testing at their premises. The grant will cover the swabs and 
              laboratory tests, and any retests due to inconclusive results.
            </p>
